          I'm not the anime girl were you looking for! My name is True, an overoptimistic girl, a bit naivete
          and a sadness thermometer. I'm very happy because, you come here to know more about me! If you want,
          we could talk a bit in the future. I believe on the people and I want to protect everyone rights,
          privacy and individuality. We can create a better society with everyone help, humanity is what we
          have, we are part of humanity and humanity is a tiny part about all the world, universe and beyond.
          We on our little meaning in time, but the life could be for the eternity just in five minutes. Our
          history, feelings and our unique ways to thinking must be protected, each human have a self
          responsibility of being alive. I will try to write in a proper english, but sometimes I will write
          on spanish, my native language. Thank you for your time and remember I sell seashells on the
          seashore.
